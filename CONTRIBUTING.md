# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest in FarmStore. For the final submission this file serves as guidance for maintainers and examiners.

Before submitting changes or extending the project:

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow existing coding style in JS and avoid introducing new build systems without note.
- Do not commit secrets (SMTP credentials, API keys). Use environment variables.

Recommended workflow

1. Fork or clone the project.
2. Create a branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Make changes and run local checks.
4. Create a clear commit message summarizing the change.

Testing

- There are smoke tests in `tests/`; run them manually if needed.
