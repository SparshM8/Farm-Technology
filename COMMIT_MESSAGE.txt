Final year project submission: FarmStore

- Added formal project deliverables: FINAL_REPORT.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/setup.md, presentation.html
- Implemented e-commerce features (product catalog, cart, checkout, admin order management)
- Image optimization pipeline: scripts/generate-images.js and image manifest support
- PWA and accessibility improvements, responsive images (WebP + JPEG via <picture>)
- Backend: Express + SQLite with server-side total calculations and order status workflow
- Realtime: Socket.IO chatbot and order notifications
- Tests: Jest + Supertest checkout integration test; CI workflow added
- Quality: ESLint + Prettier configured and applied; Docker development setup added
- Security: Admin auth hardened (bcrypt-sessions), rate-limiting added, removed header auth fallback

Notes:
- Remove node_modules from repo and rely on package.json for reproducible installs before publishing.
- For production: set ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH env var (bcrypt hash) and use HTTPS. Replace SQLite with Postgres for large-scale use.

Suggested next steps:
1) Review large assets under repository (images/node native libs) and move to releases or LFS if repo size is a concern.
2) Run `git status` and create a final commit using this message.
3) Tag release and create a ZIP for submission if required by your university.
